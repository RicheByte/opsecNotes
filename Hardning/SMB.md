# SMB (Server Message Block) Hardening

The **Server Message Block (SMB)** is a network protocol that enables shared file access, printers, serial ports, and various communications between nodes on a network. This guide presents critical steps to harden and secure the SMB service.

## Patch System Regularly

Ensure to regularly apply patches and updates on your server. This action prevents exploits of known vulnerabilities in the SMB service.

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade   # for Ubuntusudo yum update -y   # for RH-based systems
```

This command updates the system packages including SMB.

## Restrict Access

Only allow essential and authorized systems to access the SMB ports. This restriction prevents unauthorized access.

```
sudo ufw enable   # Enable firewallsudo ufw deny from {unauthorized_IP_address} to any port 445  sudo ufw deny from {unauthorized_IP_address} to any port 135
```

This command blocks access to SMB ports.

## Disable SMB 1

SMB 1 is outdated and susceptible to numerous security vulnerabilities such as ransomware attacks. Disable SMB 1 to mitigate these risks.

```
echo "[global]" >> /etc/samba/smb.confecho "min protocol = SMB2" >> /etc/samba/smb.conf
```

This command disables SMB 1 on linux servers.

On Windows Server, follow these steps:

- Open Windows Features.
- Deselect SMB 1.0/CIFS File Sharing Support, and then click OK.

## Enable SMB Signing

SMB signing verifies the authenticity of SMB communications and prevents man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

```
echo "server signing = mandatory" >> /etc/samba/smb.confecho "client signing = mandatory" >> /etc/samba/smb.conf
```

This command enables SMB signing on both the server and client sides.

## Set Strong Passwords

Use strong passwords for all user accounts. This action prevents unauthorized access.

```
sudo smbpasswd -a {username}
```

This command creates or updates the smb password of the user.

## Limit SMB Permissions

Limit permissions to what a user or a group of users need. This action prevents misuse of SMB.

```
chmod 770 {share_directory_path}sudo chown {username}:{groupname} {share_directory_path}
```

This command sets directory permissions and ownership.

## Enable SMB Encryption

Use SMB encryption to protect against eavesdropping on untrusted networks.

```
echo "smb encrypt = mandatory" >> /etc/samba/smb.conf
```

This command enables SMB encryption.

## Regular Auditing

Perform regular audits of your SMB configuration and maintain logs for analysis.

```
testparm   # Checks the Samba configuration file for internal correctness
```

This command validates smb configuration.
