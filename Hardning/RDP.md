# # RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)

This guide is intended for system administrators and security experts focused on securing **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)** services against cyber threats. It provides a series of advanced hardening strategies, complete with explanations for each recommendation.

## Enable Network Level Authentication (NLA)

NLA adds an extra layer of authentication before establishing an RDP session, reducing the risk of brute force attacks and unauthorized access.

```
1. Open the System Properties dialog.2. Navigate to Remote settings > Remote tab.3. Select 'Allow connections only from computers running Remote Desktop with Network Level Authentication.'
```

## Limit RDP Access to Specific Users

Restrict RDP access to a select group of users to minimize the attack surface and ensure that only authorized users can establish remote sessions.

```
1. Open System Properties dialog.2. Navigate to Remote settings > Remote tab.3. Click 'Select Users' and add only the users who require RDP access.
```

## Change the Default RDP Port

Changing the default RDP port (3389) can help mitigate targeted attacks and reduce the visibility of RDP services to automated scans.

```
1. Open Registry Editor (regedit).2. Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp.3. Modify the 'PortNumber' registry key to a value other than 3389.
```

## Configure Account Lockout Policies

Implement account lockout policies to deter brute force attacks by temporarily locking out accounts after a defined number of failed login attempts.

```
1. Open Local Security Policy (secpol.msc).2. Navigate to Account Policies > Account Lockout Policy.3. Configure 'Account lockout threshold' and 'Account lockout duration' settings.
```

## Enable Encryption for RDP Sessions

Ensure that RDP sessions are encrypted to protect data in transit against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

```
1. Open Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc).2. Navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Remote Desktop Services > Remote Desktop Session Host > Security.3. Enable 'Set client connection encryption level' and select 'High Level'.
```

## Use RDP Gateways

RDP Gateways provide a secure way to access internal network resources through RDP without exposing the RDP servers directly to the internet, reducing the attack surface.

## Implement Two-Factor Authentication

Adding two-factor authentication to RDP sessions significantly increases security by requiring an additional verification step beyond just a password.

## Regularly Update RDP Clients and Servers

Keeping RDP clients and servers up-to-date is crucial for protecting against vulnerabilities and ensuring the highest level of security.

## Disable Clipboard Redirection

Disabling clipboard redirection for RDP sessions helps prevent data leakage and reduces the risk of malware spreading through copy-paste actions.

## Monitor RDP Access Logs

Regular monitoring of RDP access logs is essential for detecting unauthorized access attempts and ensuring the effectiveness of implemented security measures. (Remote Desktop Protocol)
