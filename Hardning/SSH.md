# SSH (Secure Shell)

This advanced guide is crafted for system administrators and security experts who are committed to enhancing the security of their **SSH (Secure Shell)** servers. It encompasses a broad spectrum of hardening techniques, ranging from fundamental configuration adjustments to complex security mechanisms, with detailed explanations for each recommendation.

## Enforce SSH Protocol 2

SSH Protocol 2 is the latest version and offers improved security features over Protocol 1, including more robust encryption algorithms and host-based authentication. Enforcing its use ensures that communications are better protected.

```
# /etc/ssh/sshd_configProtocol 2
```

## Disable Root Login

Disabling root login over SSH reduces the risk of unauthorized access by requiring users to authenticate as a non-privileged user before escalating privileges. This minimizes the potential impact of brute force attacks.

```
# /etc/ssh/sshd_configPermitRootLogin no
```

## Employ Key-Based Authentication

Key-based authentication is more secure than password-based authentication, as it relies on cryptographic keys that are much harder to brute force. It significantly enhances the security of SSH access.

```
# /etc/ssh/sshd_configPasswordAuthentication noAuthenticationMethods publickey
```

## Restrict SSH Access to Specific Users

Limiting SSH access to specific users reduces the attack surface by ensuring only authorized personnel have remote access, enhancing overall system security.

```
# /etc/ssh/sshd_configAllowUsers specified_user
```

## Alter the Default SSH Port

Changing the default SSH port (22) can help mitigate automated attacks and scans targeting default SSH ports, reducing the visibility to automated threats.

```
# /etc/ssh/sshd_configPort 2222
```

## Activate Fail2Ban

Fail2Ban monitors login attempts to SSH and automatically bans IPs that exhibit malicious behavior, such as repeated failed login attempts, helping to protect against brute-force attacks.

## Schedule SSH Key Rotation

Regularly rotating SSH keys minimizes the risk of exposure and compromise, ensuring that access remains secure even if a key is somehow leaked or stolen.

## Implement Two-Factor Authentication

Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification beyond the SSH key, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

```
# /etc/ssh/sshd_configAuthenticationMethods publickey,keyboard-interactive
```

## Harden SSH Ciphers

Specifying strong ciphers for SSH sessions enhances the encryption strength, protecting against cryptographic attacks that target weaker encryption algorithms.

```
# /etc/ssh/sshd_configCiphers aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr
```

## Limit SSH Sessions

Limiting the number of concurrent SSH sessions per user can help prevent resource exhaustion and potential denial of service attacks.

```
# /etc/ssh/sshd_configMaxSessions 2
```

## Configure Idle Timeout

Setting an idle timeout disconnects inactive sessions, reducing the risk of session hijacking and conserving system resources.

```
# /etc/ssh/sshd_configClientAliveInterval 300ClientAliveCountMax 0
```

## Use Security Extensions

Security extensions like SELinux or AppArmor add an additional layer of security, enforcing strict access controls around the SSH service and further securing the system.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

## Audit SSH Access (Log Analysis)

Regularly reviewing SSH access logs is crucial for detecting unauthorized access attempts and ensuring that access controls are effective.

## Update SSH Software Regularly

Keeping SSH server software up to date is essential for protecting against newly discovered vulnerabilities and maintaining a secure environment.
