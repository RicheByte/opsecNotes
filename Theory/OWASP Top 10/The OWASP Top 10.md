### **The OWASP Top 10: A Motherfucking Introduction**

First off, OWASP stands for the **Open Web Application Security Project**. It's a fucking non-profit foundation that works to improve the security of software. Every few years, they release a list of the **10 most critical web application security risks**. Think of it as a wanted poster for the most dangerous fuckers trying to break your apps.

For a noob, this list is your fucking bible. Memorize it. Live by it.

Here is the goddamn list of what we're going to cover, one by one:

1. **Broken Access Control** 🚪
    
2. **Cryptographic Failures** 🔐
    
3. **Injection** 💉
    
4. **Insecure Design** 🏛️
    
5. **Security Misconfiguration** ⚙️
    
6. **Vulnerable and Outdated Components** 📦
    
7. **Identification and Authentication Failures** 🎭
    
8. **Software and Data Integrity Failures** 📉
    
9. **Security Logging and Monitoring Failures** 📡
    
10. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** 🌐
    

We'll start with the first and most common son of a bitch on the list.
